# Design Plan for Creative Coding Group Project

## Part I: Imaging Technique Inspiration

The imaging technique that we plan to use is to use 
![123](image/moon.jpg)
to form arbitrary shapes and their textures. The inspiration comes from xxxx (TODO: given two artwork examples with figures). The reason we choose it is xxxxxx (TODO: explain why you believe it's a benefical technique).

## Part II: Coding Technique Exploration

We plan to use Javascript and p5.js to implement the imaging technique. More specifically, the coding techniques are as follows:

1. Create Perlin noise using p5.js.
2. Create an object with a sin/cos based broadline using the Javascript examples in Week5's tutorial.
3. Create the textures for the object with ![123](image/moon.jpg)generated by sin/cos function and Perlin noise.

Below is the figure showing coding technique in action, and [this link](https://josephg.com/perlin/3/p.js) shows an example implementation.
